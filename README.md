Homework 2: As we didn't cover the entirety of the topics for HW 2, the parts related to the lasso/relaxed lasso
were pushed to HW 2b.  There are two sets of solutions to HW 2 posted: 

* 2_solutionNoLasso: This just answers the adjusted HW 2, without the lasso.
* 2_solution: This answers the original HW 2.  Hence, it includes answers to HW 2b.

It would be in your best interest to try and answer HW 2b without looking at 2_solutionNoLasso.  But, it is 
there if you feel like you need it.
